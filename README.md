## Bookshop_Inventory_System

- About the Project

A book shop maintains the inventory of books that are being sold at the shop. The list includes details such as author, title, price, publisher and stock position. Whenever a customer wants a book, the title and the author of the book is entered and the system searches the list and displays whether it is available or not. If it is not, an appropriate message is displayed. If it is, then the system displays the book details and requests for the number of copies required. If the requested copies book details and requests for the number of copies required. If the requested copies are available, the total cost of the requested copies is displayed; otherwise the message “Required copies not in stock” is displayed.

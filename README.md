## Bookshop_Inventory_System

- About the Project

A book shop maintains the inventory of books that are being sold at the shop. The list includes details such as author, title, price, publisher and stock position. Whenever a customer wants a book, the title and the author of the book is entered and the system searches the list and displays whether it is available or not. If it is not, an appropriate message is displayed. If it is, then the system displays the book details and requests for the number of copies required. If the requested copies book details and requests for the number of copies required. If the requested copies are available, the total cost of the requested copies is displayed; otherwise the message “Required copies not in stock” is displayed.

If we select choice number 3 that says "Search a book" is used when we want to know if a particular book is availble or not. Firstly, It will ask us to type the title as well as the author name of the book and on the basis of the details entered it will check if the required book is availble or not. If found, it will display "Book Found Successfully" and give us the various important details about the book.
